## Brief Overview 
Stereographic Projection is a smooth bijective mapping from a plane to a sphere. The mapping is a conformal projection preserving angles and circles. That is the image of a circle on the sphere is a circle in the plane and the angle between two lines on the sphere is the same as the angle between their images in the plane. A smooth curve lying on the plane can be projected to the sphere. Any smooth planar curve has zero torsion and some curvature. As a result of the preservative properties of the projection mapping we are able to make a bijective mapping of the curvature and torsion of a curve to the curvature and torsion of its projected image. Such mapping allows for a dynamical system to be built. Each iterate of the system takes in a smooth parametric planar curve and outputs a smooth parametric curve. The parametric curve created from the output of each iterate is defined by the mapping of the projected curvature and torsion of the input curve. </br>

## Mathematical Formalization
This repository builds the core foundational logic to build a dynamical system from mapping of curvature and torsion of image of parametric planar curve when stereographically projected to the unit sphere. </br>

Let $\alpha(t)$ be a an arbitrary parametric curve residing the plane $z=-1$. This will be the seed to our dynamical system. Suppose we have some mapping $\beta: \mathbb{R}^2->\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\beta(\alpha(t))$ represents the [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection) of $\alpha(t)$ onto the unit sphere. 
Such that 
```math
\begin{equation}
    \beta \cdot \alpha(t) = \beta \cdot \alpha \begin{pmatrix}
    x(t)\\
    y(t)\\
    \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{4x(t)}{x(t)^2+y(t)^2+4} \\
    \frac{4y(t)}{x(t)^2+y(t)^2+4} \\
    \frac{x(t)^2+y(t)^2-4}{x(t)^2+y(t)^2+4}
    \end{pmatrix}
    
\end{equation}
```
Notice first that this projection $\beta(\alpha(t))$ now has some [curvature](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Curvature.html) $\kappa(t)$ & some [torsion](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Torsion.html) $\tau(t)$. Notice something very interesting the curvature $\kappa(t)$ and torsion $\tau(t)$ actually trace a smooth planar curve in the same parametric form as our original seed $\alpha(t)$, Let $\phi(t)=[\kappa(t),\tau(t), -1]$ be such curve. This represent the output of the first iterate, and the input to the second iterate of our dynamical system. The dynamical system will continue this methodology by iteratively projecting the output of each iterate and reprojecting downward the curvature and torsion in the form Let $[\kappa(t),\tau(t), -1]$.

## Analysis of Families of curves. 

Let $f: \mathbb{R}^2->\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined as $f^1(\phi(t)) = \phi^1(t)=[\kappa^1(t),\tau^1(t), -1]$ where $\kappa(t)$ and $\tau(t)$ represent the curvature and torsion of the image of $\phi^0(t)$ on the unit sphere. Then $f^n(\phi(t)) = \phi^n(t)=[\kappa^n(t),\tau^n(t)]$ would be the $n_{th}$ iterate of $f$ which would be the result of stereographically projecting $[\kappa(t),\tau(t),-1]$ and recalculating the projected curvature and torsion over $n$ iterates.

## The behavior I am hoping to Analyze

**Try to find fixed points in the system --> if $\phi(t) =[x(t),y(t), -1]$ then if $f(\phi(t))=\phi^1(t)$ we have $\phi^1(t)=[\kappa(f(\phi(t)),\kappa(f(\phi(t))]=\phi(t)$. The above result would be the case when $\phi(t)$ represents a planar parametric circle, but is there other cases where this could be true? To be honest, I am not sure.. but I want to know üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.**
</br>

**Does convergence happen for some curves over an orbit of high order. Further what is the curve that the orbit of 
$f^n(\phi(t))$ is converging to. Is it always the same cure? Is it a circle? And what topological inferences could we learn from such a result. **
</br>

**Does chaos ever arise in such a system? My intuition tells me no, but to be completely honest this is just a hunch.**
</br>

**Categorizing behavior of families of curves in the dynamical system based on the results.**
